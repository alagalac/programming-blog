The SOLID Principles are a set of principles which when applied together help to
guide the architecture of object oriented applications so that they can more
easily be maintained over time.

The SOLID Principles are a good guide for working on any large scale
application.

Many of the ideas here complement and re-enforce one another. They should not be
considered separately, but should rather be considered as different aspects of a
collective whole.
