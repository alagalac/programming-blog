Never rely on the implementation details being a secret.

## Explaination

Your system should be secure even in potential adversaries have 100% knowledge
of how it works.

Given enough time and determination a hacker can Ô¨Ågure out almost everything
about a system. Security through obscurity also provides no defence against one
of the most common and dangerous sources of potential intrusions: disgruntled
ex-employees. They will have full knowledge of how the system works.

## Example

An excellent example of this is the emulators which have been written for most
video game consoles. Hackers have spent countless hours to completely
reverse-engineer the core workings of most consoles through trial and error so
that video games can be emulated.
